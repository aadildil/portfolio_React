            <p>I'm Aadil P M, 
                hailing from a diverse cultural background. Armed with a Mechanical Engineering degree from the prestigious
                 National Institute of Technology Karnataka, my journey began as a mechanical engineer at Qatar Energy, where 
                 I honed my problem-solving skills. However, my heart was always set on programming. This passion led me to 
                 take a leap of faith, embarking on a journey into the world of full-stack Java development.

                Today, I'm a dedicated learner and practitioner of Java, C++, C, MySQL, JavaScript, React, 
                HTML, CSS, Spring Boot, and Hibernate. My thirst for knowledge extends beyond coding.
                I've also ventured into the realm of graphics design. In my local community, I've set up a learning hub,
                 driven by my enthusiasm for teaching. My professional journey is a fusion of engineering,
               programming, and education, and I'm excited about the limitless possibilities that lie ahead in my career.</p>
